        <h2>AI's haiku</h2>
        <p>I don't know what a haiku or limerick is, so I asked an AI to generate a haiku for me about lightposts.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; font-family: cursive; line-height: 2em;">Steel sentinels glow <br>
            Circles of warmth on asphalt <br>
            Night learns where to walk
        </p>

        <h2>My Interests:</h2>
        <p>Having grown up in the mountains of Norway, I have had a deep love of nature ever since I was a child. Today, that takes the form of hiking in the mountains, and skiing. That is why I am so thankful for having moved to Utah where you have such beautiful mountains, with pleanty of opportunities for both hiking and skiing.</p>
        <p>Additionally I really like to go running. I used to play a lot of fotball back in Norway but after an injury I had to stop playing for a few years during which I started running. Running has allowed me to stay in shape while also making new friends.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I enjoy college and studying. Being allowed to study something I am passionate about while also having the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends is something I am very grateful for. While also being allowed to stay here in the United States for a few years.</p>
